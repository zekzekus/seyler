This project is a command line interface for the famous productivity application [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/). It uses the new feature called [URL Schemes](https://support.culturedcode.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2803573) of the app.

Things app is a Mac only app so this will only useful for MacOS. There is no official HTTP API or something like that so at the moment best way to interact with things application is this.
